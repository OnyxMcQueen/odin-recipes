  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>
    Our <strong>Classic Pizza</strong> features a perfectly crispy crust topped with a rich tomato sauce, gooey mozzarella cheese, and your choice of favorite toppings. 
    The dough is made from scratch, allowing it to rise and develop a delightful texture that’s both chewy and crisp. 
    After spreading a layer of tangy tomato sauce, it’s generously covered with mozzarella cheese, which melts into a deliciously gooey layer.

  <p>
    Baked to perfection in a hot oven, this pizza comes out with a golden crust and bubbling cheese. 
    Whether you choose to add pepperoni, mushrooms, or bell peppers, each slice delivers a satisfying combination of flavors that will make this classic pizza a staple in your recipe collection.
