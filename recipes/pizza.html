  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>
    Our <strong>Classic Pizza</strong> features a perfectly crispy crust topped with a rich tomato sauce, gooey mozzarella cheese, and your choice of favorite toppings. 
    The dough is made from scratch, allowing it to rise and develop a delightful texture that’s both chewy and crisp. 
    After spreading a layer of tangy tomato sauce, it’s generously covered with mozzarella cheese, which melts into a deliciously gooey layer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Baked to perfection in a hot oven, this pizza comes out with a golden crust and bubbling cheese. 
    Whether you choose to add pepperoni, mushrooms, or bell peppers, each slice delivers a satisfying combination of flavors that will make this classic pizza a staple in your recipe collection.

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol class="secondary-list">
    <li class="secondary-list-item">
      <strong>Prepare the dough</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes, or until it becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine 3 1/2 cups of flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
        <li>Mix until the dough begins to come together, then turn it out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes, adding more flour as needed, until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="secondary-list-item">
      <strong>Prepare the sauce</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the tomato sauce, dried oregano, dried basil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Mix well and set aside.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="secondary-list-item">
      <strong>Preheat the oven</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it preheats.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="secondary-list-item">
      <strong>Shape the dough</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two portions (for two pizzas) or keep it whole for one large pizza.</li>
        <li>On a floured surface, roll out the dough to your desired thickness and shape. If you’re using a pizza stone, transfer the rolled-out dough onto a piece of parchment paper.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="secondary-list-item">
      <strong>Assemble the pizza</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the prepared tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce. Add any additional toppings you like.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="secondary-list-item">
      <strong>Bake the pizza</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Transfer the pizza (with parchment paper, if using a stone) onto a baking sheet or pizza stone.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="secondary-list-item">
      <strong>Finish and Serve</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves and a drizzle of olive oil, if desired.</li>
        <li>Slice and enjoy your homemade classic pizza!</li>
