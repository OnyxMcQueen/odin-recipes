# My Recipe Website

## Introduction

Welcome to **My Recipe Website**, a simple and user-friendly platform showcasing a variety of delicious recipes. This website is designed to help you find and prepare tasty dishes, ranging from quick snacks to full meals. 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my web development skills by creating a functional, visually appealing site using **HTML** and **CSS**. As I continue developing this project, I will highlight key features, such as:

- Easy-to-navigate recipe categories
- Detailed recipe pages
- Responsive design for all devices

## Reflection (to be completed)

Once the project is finished, I will reflect on the skills I've demonstrated and the tools used throughout the process. Stay tuned for more!
